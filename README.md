Digital Service Portal for NEA – Simplifying Access to Electricity Services in Nepal
## Problem Statement 

Even though digital governance seems to have increasingly become a necessity, a significant number of the fundamental services provided by the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) remain subject to the offline processes. The customers also have to traverse to NEA offices to undertake bill inquiries, issue complaints as well as power outages. This is one of the causes of inefficiency, huge lines, slow response, and poor satisfaction of the citizens. Lack of centralized and accessible platform bring in the disparity between the expectations of people as citizens on the one hand and the factual delivery of the services on the other. A digital transformation is urgently needed to make delivery of electricity-relevant services easy to the masses in public.
## Introduction
Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) plays the crucial role of the national power system of the country as it deals with the production, transmission, and distribution of electricity to millions of customers in the country of Nepal. Although this organization is vast and its services are significant, a considerable number of services offered by NEA to citizens continue to operate with a predominance of offline work, which slows down the work and is inconvenient to citizens. Ordinary tasks like payment of electricity bills, complaints related to power services, and following up on the power outages or finding the office of NEA usually involve physical presence, long queues or follow-ups. The fact that there is a difference between the delivery of service and citizen expectations reveals the dire need to transform the public service model of NEA towards a digital experience.

We suggest the introduction of the central and convenient digital service portal, called NEA Connect, that will transfer critical services of NEA to online. Its basic features, accessible through the web-based platform, include inspection of the electricity bills with the help of its customer ID, complaint registration with category-based search and optional photo uploading, real-time schedule of load-shedding, and provision of feedback to the NEA administration. Another benefit of the platform is that citizens are able to monitor the progress of their complaints thus, this helps in achieving transparency and it will lead to accountability. It also provides district-wise NEA office locator that would enable consumers to know their closest service office. The features are developed using easy technologies in order to make it responsive and inclusive over devices.

NEA Connect is more than just about the convenience of the consumers; it is about lightening the workload of the NEA physical counters in requesting repetitive services encountered by the consumers. The system is capable of providing high efficiency to the user through the use of the latest web technology. The optional features are the admin dashboard that runs along with the NEA staff, to listen to the user complaints, post public announcements and update schedules. In short, this project will enhance transparency, timeliness and delivery of the electricity services in Nepal in general- and creating a more connected and digitally enabled future.

## Objectives 
•	Improve access to essential electricity services such as bill inquiries, power updates, and complaint registration.

•	Reduce pressure on NEA’s physical counters by enabling digital self-service options.

•	Increase transparency and user trust through status tracking and timely updates.

## Scope of the Project
The  objective of the NEA Connect project is to conceptualize and operationalize a centralized and web-based digital space with an aim of digitalisation and optimizing the major functions of the Nepal Electricity Authority that are provided to the general citizenry. These services are electricity bills query, online payment, registering cases of complaints and monitoring of the same, up-to-date notification of load-shedding, branch office finder, and request of new electricity connection. The system will considerably lessen the dependency on physical office visits, wait lines and handicrafts in its systems by taking these important functions online. The data this will translate into increased accessibility of services by people in all parts of the country of Nepal.

Moreover, the platform will also contain an admin dashboard to assist staff at NEA in processing citizen complaints, updating outage reports and user comments. Although the current form of the project will deal with the accessibility over the web, hardware-based meter connection, SMS messaging, and direct backend API connection to third-party payment processing services such as eSewa or Khalti will not be available even in this version. Nonetheless, these elaborate features can be inserted at later stages of development since, despite using a modular and scalable architecture, it is built leaving space to add such features.

## Proposed Solution
The solution is a centralized digital platform named NEA Connect, offering the following features:

Public Features :

• Electricity Bill Checker :

With their own Customer ID, users will find it very easy to examine their current electricity bill online. This makes it unnecessary to make visits to physical counters or wait till printed bills are available thereby making the process transparent and fast.

•	Complaint Registration :

There is a special form that citizens can use to make complaints regarding electricity. They are allowed to divide the issue in question, describe it and provide a picture if they want to. One is to enter a complaint and the response generates a unique Complaint ID which can be followed.

•	Complaint Tracking :

Users will be in a position to follow up their registered complaints-in-real time by using the given Complaint ID. The aspect enhances accountability and confidence in the response of NEA.

•	Load-Shedding Notifications :

There is clear display of areas that have power outage and load shedding schedules. Customers are able to choose their area to get some actual and topical information so that to plan their affairs become better organized.


•	Branch Locator :

There is also an interactive branch locator that enables people to locate the closest NEA office. They can make inquiries district wise or have a visual map interface where they seek out the contact information of office branches.

•	New connection request :

Online application may be done by a user to connect his or her home or business to a power energy source. Online version is easier than a paper one and does not require personal appearances as often.

•	Pay Bill Online :

The payment can be done through eSewa, Khalti, and bank transfer as the platform has built-in payment options which the user can enjoy without problems.
